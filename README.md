# Dev-ops-project-collection 2
Number of dev-ops projects i took as a challenge from https://www.tutorialworks.com/devops-project-ideas/
##

I found this collection of projects and wanted to challenge my self incrementally on my learning journey.
Along my learning path i would like this to be a guide for others, so that i can help people learning Dev-Ops 
and add aditional challenge for me personally to write better guides. 

# Project 2. Create and run a CI/CD pipeline for an app
